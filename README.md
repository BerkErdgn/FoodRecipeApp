# Food Recipe App
This is a recipe application. Thanks to this application, users can access detailed recipes.

There is a list of food categories at the top of the app's homepage. Users can choose "Beef", "Chicken", "Dessert", etc. You can choose one of the categories. According to the category they selected, a list of the Dishes belonging to that category will be displayed.

When users select a dish, they are directed to a detailed page with the recipe's ingredients and preparation. This page contains the ingredients of the recipe, its step-by-step preparation and a photo of the resulting dish.
